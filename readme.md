This is a simple calculator built using HTML, CSS and Javascript.
I learned basic DOM manipulation, array methods, and other fundamentals prior to this project.

Project plan:

1.  Build calculator button layout with HTML
2.  Add styling with CSS
3.  Add operator functions
4.  Add triggers to buttons
5.  Add function to calculate the result and output to DOM
